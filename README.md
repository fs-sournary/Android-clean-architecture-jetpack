# Android-clean-architecture-jetpack

## 1, Overview
This sample uses components that is introduced in the Jetpack library to implement clean architecture.

It focuses on problems that developers often resolve in their project:
- Fetch data from server and handle related use cases: refresh, retry...
- Get data from database or preference.
- Handle configuration change: rotation, input method...
- App is killed because system need more resource.

## 2, Libraries

- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
- [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/)
- [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/)
